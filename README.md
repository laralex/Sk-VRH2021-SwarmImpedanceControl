# DNN/RL-based impedance control of heterogeneous swarm (mobile robot + virtually linked swarm of drones)
The Final project of Virtual Reality and Haptics 2021 course at Skoltech, Russia. 

Team members:
* Gabriel Rozzonelli
* Shahzeb Aamir
* Alexey Larionov
* Aleksey Fedoseev (TA)
* Dzmitry Tsetserukou (course instructor)

Inspired by the paper

* [SwarmTouch: Tactile Interaction of Human with Impedance Controlled Swarm of Nano-Quadrotors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03491)

### Brief repository overview
The project is a Unity application that uses [ML agents
toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) for creating a
playground filled with robots in control of Artificial Intelligence (we
experiment with Reinforcement Learning and other approaches)
