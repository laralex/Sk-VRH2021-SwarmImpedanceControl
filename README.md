### Brief repository overview
The project is a Unity 2019.4.15f1 application that uses [ML agents
toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) for creating a
playground filled with robots in control of Artificial Intelligence (we
experiment with Reinforcement Learning and other approaches).

To use this repository, you would need to manually install ML agents toolkit using [their recommended steps](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_17_docs/docs/Installation.md) (basically download [release 17](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/release_17_docs#releases--documentation), in Unity install packages `com.unity.ml-agents` and `com.unity.ml-agents.extensions` from downloaded release 17, install Python package `mlagents==0.26.0`.
